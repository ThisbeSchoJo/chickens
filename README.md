# 🐔 Chickens

**Chickens** is a simple, location-based app that connects people who raise backyard chickens with nearby folks looking for fresh eggs. Sellers can list available eggs, acreage size, and delivery options. Buyers can browse local listings and get a visual sense of how the chickens are raised.

## 🌟 Features (Planned)

- Add your flock, number of eggs available, and price
- Map-based search to find nearby egg sellers
- Acreage-based visualizations (how much space the chickens have)
- Optional delivery or pickup flags
- Clean, minimalist interface

## 💻 Tech Stack

- React frontend
- Flask or Node.js backend (TBD)
- SQLite or PostgreSQL for storage
- Leaflet or Google Maps API for geographic display

## 🚧 Status

This app is currently in development. Stay tuned for fresh eggs and fresh code!
